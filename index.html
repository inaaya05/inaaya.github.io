      Hi! My name is Inaaya and welcome to my website!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a current senior in highschool in New Jersey. I have many hobbies including coding, reading, designing nails, and watching TV! Currently, I am exploring computer science through classes at school and programs outside of school such as Girls Who Code and Kode with Klossy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I first got started with coding when I did Girls Who Code in 10th grade. I loved how I was able to create personal projects as well as projects related to activism and social justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I hope to pursue Data Science and use my skills to help others and make change, no matter how small.
